# Qwen3.8-27B on a single RTX 3090 — BATCH / THROUGHPUT mode.
# Measured: ~1,000 tok/s aggregate @ 64 concurrent (128 in / 512 out), 150k context.
#
# Hard-won settings, don't change casually:
#  - --mamba-ssm-cache-dtype float16: the Gated DeltaNet recurrent state is
#    fp32 by default (Qwen's config says so) and costs ~150 MB per resident
#    request; fp16 halves that AND halves the state traffic per decode step.
#    That is what lets all 64 requests actually run at once (fp32: only 37).
#    Perplexity is unchanged (8.045 vs 8.046 on our en/da/code check).
#  - VLLM_MARLIN_INPUT_DTYPE=int8: int8 tensor-core (W4A8) Marlin path for the
#    MLP GEMMs, weights stay int4. Roughly +35% aggregate on top of the state
#    change for +2.2% perplexity. Needs both marlin patches from patches/.
#    INT8_LAYERS=gate_up is the gentler variant (+0.9% PPL, ~+15%);
#    INT8_ACT= (empty) turns it off entirely (pure W4A16, quality-neutral).
#  - --language-model-only skips the vision tower entirely (0.858 GiB on this
#    checkpoint); VISION=1 keeps it for a client that sends images
#  - expandable_segments is required: the DeltaNet prefill kernels allocate
#    transient workspace and fragment the allocator, OOMs at util >= 0.978 without it
#  - gpu-memory-utilization 0.95 on vLLM 0.29 (0.972 on 0.28): see the KV=fp8
#    branch below for why the default moved with the pin
#  - max-num-batched-tokens 2048 beats 8192 here: bigger chunks inflate the
#    profiled activation peak, which shrinks the KV/state page pool
#  - kv-cache-dtype fp8 roughly doubles the usable context/pool
