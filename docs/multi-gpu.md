# More than one GPU

What transfers to a second card and what does not, plus the tensor-parallel
shapes this model's head count allows.

[← back to the main README](../README.md)

Everything here is written for one 24 GB card; multi-GPU goes through untouched
via `EXTRA_ARGS`:

```bash
SPEC=dflash2 PREFIX_CACHE=1 EXTRA_ARGS="--tensor-parallel-size 2" bash single-user/start_qwen.sh
```

**`--tensor-parallel-size 3` is not valid for this model.** The checkpoint's
text config has 4 KV heads and 64 layers:

```bash
curl -sL https://huggingface.co/dbirks/Qwen3.8-27B-W4A16-AutoRound/raw/main/config.json \
  | python3 -c "import json,sys; t=json.load(sys.stdin)['text_config']; print(t['num_key_value_heads'], t['num_hidden_layers'])"
# 4 64
```

Tensor parallelism needs the KV-head count and the TP size to divide one
another, and 4 and 3 do neither way; pipeline parallelism needs an even layer
split, and 64 does not divide by 3. So on a three-card box the third card
cannot join the engine — run a TP=2 engine on two cards plus a second
standalone engine on the third
([#104](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/issues/104)), and if both
serve containers share one host, set `VLLM_OFFLOAD_KEEP_SHM=1` on both: each
launcher's stale-offload-region reaper only sees its own container's processes
and would delete the other engine's live region
([#33](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/issues/33)).

Under Docker, the same two knobs live in `.env` — `GPU_COUNT` says how many
cards the container gets, `EXTRA_ARGS` says how many the engine uses, and
nothing in `docker-compose.yml` needs editing:

```
GPU_COUNT=2
EXTRA_ARGS="--tensor-parallel-size 2"
```

(The launchers already pass `--language-model-only` unless `VISION=1`, so it does not
belong in `EXTRA_ARGS`; an earlier version of this example repeated it.)

`GPU_COUNT` defaults to 1, which is *the first card the runtime enumerates* —
GPU 0, not necessarily the card you meant. On a mixed box, expose them all and
pin inside the container with `GPU_COUNT=all` plus `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1,2`
(the device reservation decides what is visible, so `NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`
in `.env` alone was not enough; `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` is read inside the
container and is what gotcha 53 recommends). Set `CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER=PCI_BUS_ID`
as well: by default CUDA numbers the fastest card first, so on a box that mixes
generations `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1` can name a different pair than `nvidia-smi`
shows. That happens on native Linux too, not only under WSL2: a 5080 was paired
with a 3080 that way in [#216](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/issues/216).

**Pin the KV pool before you measure anything, or before you trim `MAX_LEN`
until the OOMs stop.** Under `--tensor-parallel-size > 1` the launcher
deliberately skips the single-card `KV_MEM` pin (below), and `SPEC=mtp` has no
profile pin at all — so the pool is sized from `GPU_UTIL`, and the headroom it
is carved out of moves by ~0.92 GiB depending on whether the torch.compile
cache was warm (`docs/gotchas.md` 48). That is the "booted at 146k yesterday,
OOMs today" failure. To pin it, boot once at a context that works and read the
two lines the engine prints:

```bash
docker compose logs single | grep -E "Available KV cache memory|GPU KV cache size"
# INFO ... Available KV cache memory: 3.36 GiB
# INFO ... GPU KV cache size: 161,280 tokens
```

then put a byte count a little under that `GiB` figure into `.env` as
`KV_MEM=` (3.36 GiB ≈ 3607772528 bytes; round down). `KV_MEM` overrides the
TP skip — the launcher only declines to pin one *for* you. A pinned pool
either fits at boot or refuses at boot, instead of OOMing on the first
request, and it is the only way two benchmark arms are comparable.

**On 8-12 GB cards, vLLM 0.29 can size a pool that does not leave room for
warmup.** 0.29's memory accounting returns memory that 0.27/0.28 held back, so
the same `GPU_UTIL` gives a bigger pool. On two 12 GB 3060s at `GPU_UTIL=0.915`
the fp8 pool went from 2.41 GiB to 3.01 GiB per card, and `SPEC=mtp CTX=long`
then ran out of memory in sampler warmup. The pin vLLM's own error message
suggests (`--kv-cache-memory=2975129437`, 155,316 tokens) booted and serves
128k ([#68](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/issues/68)). On four 8 GB 3060
Tis at TP=4, setups A, B, C and D all ran out of memory at startup at their
shipped settings, and only E booted as shipped
([#210](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/issues/210)). Until
[#214](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/pull/214), the launcher passes
`KV_MEM` to vLLM only under `SPEC=dflash2`. Under `SPEC=mtp` or `SPEC=off`,
pass the pin as `EXTRA_ARGS="... --kv-cache-memory=<bytes>"`.

What the second card is worth is now measured, not assumed —
[#40](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/issues/40) ran a controlled
1-vs-2×3090 A/B on this harness (same box, same install, PCIe 4.0 x8, **no
NVLink**, 275 W):

- **+16–35% decode across C1–C8** (DFlash2 greedy: 127.4 → 161.6 at C1). Worth
  it at batch 1: decode is bandwidth-bound here, and TP=2 is a second memory
  system, not idle compute.
- **The DFlash2 residency ceiling is a 24 GB property, not a drafter
  property.** On one card DFlash2 collapses at C8 (3.9 s TTFT — the
  recurrent-state pool exhaustion documented above) and MTP wins; on two cards
  DFlash2 wins at every concurrency measured. On 2×24 GB, point everyone at
  DFlash2.
- **The launcher no longer pins `KV_MEM` under TP>1** (their finding, this
  fix): the pin is a single-card constant applied per worker, and it stranded
  ~16 GiB across two cards — 137,210 tokens of pool where `GPU_UTIL` sizing
  gets 302,223, at no measured decode cost. Export `KV_MEM` to pin anyway.
- **Keep `DFLASH_TOKENS=7` at TP>1** for now: the one T=15 datapoint at TP=2
  (same issue) lost 27% at C1 with the lookup-filled tail accepting nothing,
  which is under diagnosis. The launcher warns.
- NVLink appears to buy little:
  [#7](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/issues/7)'s NVLink box at
  330 W and #40's PCIe-x8 box at 275 W land within a few percent of each other
  at C1.
- **Past two cards, or on a consumer board with the cards on separate PCIe root
  ports, you may need `NCCL_P2P_LEVEL=SYS`** and
  `EXTRA_ARGS="--disable-custom-all-reduce"`. Reported from a 4x RTX 5060 Ti box
  on a community-patched P2P driver
  ([#105](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/issues/105)): NCCL would
  not bring up peer-to-peer across four separate root ports until P2P was forced
  down to `SYS`, and vLLM's custom all-reduce faulted on that driver even at
  TP=2. Neither is reproducible on this repo's single-card box, so treat both as
  field reports, not as defaults — try TP first without them.

```bash
NCCL_P2P_LEVEL=SYS SPEC=dflash2 PREFIX_CACHE=1 \
  EXTRA_ARGS="--tensor-parallel-size 4 --disable-custom-all-reduce" \
  bash single-user/start_qwen.sh
```

**2x RTX 3090 with NVLink, both profiles, one box.** The fullest dual-card
report this repo has ([#159](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/issues/159),
[#163](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/issues/163),
[#164](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/issues/164): NV4 link, 250 W per
card, driver 595.91.07, Docker, vLLM 0.28.0, harness runs with a discarded
warmup and three measured repeats).

- **Start by turning the allocator off, not custom all-reduce off.** This box
  first came up only with `--disable-custom-all-reduce`; the crash behind that
  is the expandable-segments/IPC interaction in `docs/gotchas.md` 3, and
  clearing it properly is worth +6.4% at C1 (171.8 -> 182.8 tok/s greedy,
  3.32 tok/step in both arms) and ~9% at C4. Both launchers now default
  `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:False` when `EXTRA_ARGS` asks
  for TP>1 without `--disable-custom-all-reduce` or `--enforce-eager`, and say
  so at boot; set the variable yourself to override either way. That 182.8 is the single-user
  row in [docs/reproductions](reproductions/README.md), and it is the fastest
  C1 decode reported on Ampere here.
- **Batch, setup A, is where the second card pays.** `GPU_COUNT=2` with
  `EXTRA_ARGS="--tensor-parallel-size 2"` on the documented batch defaults
  (base checkpoint, `KV=fp8`, `INT8_ACT=int8 INT8_LAYERS=mlp`, `MAX_SEQS=64`,
  `MAX_LEN=150000`, no speculation, no prefix cache) gives 1,439 tok/s decode
  and 1,344 e2e at 64 concurrent on 128 in / 512 out, against ~1,035 / 948 on
  one card: **+39% aggregate**, with an 872,938-token KV pool and GSM8K 0.965
  over 200. Three measured repeats landed within 1% of each other.
- **That contradicts the other dual-3090 batch report, and the profile is
  why.** [#135](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/issues/135) measured 917
  decode at 64 concurrent on two cards -- *less* than one card -- but ran
  `KV=kvarn VISION=1` rather than the reference batch profile. Two cards do
  not make a batch server slower; a different KV dtype and a loaded vision
  tower do. Match the profile before you compare aggregates.
- **Single-user C1 does not scale the same way**, and that is expected: batch
  1 decode is bandwidth-bound, so TP=2 buys the ~35% in
  [#40](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/issues/40) and this box's +37%
  over the 133 tok/s reference, while the batch profile gets a second memory
  system *and* a second set of SMs to fill.

- **Without NVLink, custom all-reduce needs peer access, not the bridge.** A
  2x3090 box on PCIe x8 (no NVLink) with peer access enabled by a
  community-patched driver ran vLLM's custom all-reduce under the launcher's
  `expandable_segments:False` default. It measured +6.5 to +7.2% at C1 greedy
  over NCCL (`bench/real_rep.sh`, 4 reps per arm, identical `tok/step`), about
  the NVLink box's +6.4%. A fragmentation soak (200k prefills with concurrent
  60k prompts) held to `GPU_UTIL=0.96`, and both allocator settings failed
  the same way at 0.97, so the `:False` default costs nothing measurable
  there ([#163](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/issues/163)).

**Without peer-to-peer at all, TP=2 can be slower than one card, and data
parallel is what the second card buys.** 2x RTX 4090 (Ada, where NVIDIA
disables P2P on consumer cards), one at PCIe 4.0 x8 and one at x4, Docker on
WSL2 ([#190](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/issues/190)). NCCL runs the
all-reduce over host shared memory, and the custom all-reduce cannot run
without P2P:

| | one card | TP=2 | DP=2 (`--data-parallel-size 2`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 greedy, default `SPEC=mtp` profile | 151.1 tok/s | 118.7 | |
| batch burst, 128 requests at 64-way, ~1,478 in / 256 out | 76.2 s | 110.9 s | **39.6 s** (1.92x one card) |
| KV pool | 215,721 (batch) | 896,134 | 215,721 per engine |

(Both cards had no other GPU clients for these runs. A Windows app holding a
context on the same card slowed TP=2's batch burst by another 17%.) So on a
no-P2P pair, run `--data-parallel-size 2`: one endpoint, one engine per card,
and no per-layer all-reduce. Use TP=2 only when a single request needs the
~4x pool. If you do, `NCCL_PROTO=LL` recovered about a third of TP=2's C1
loss there (113.7 -> 127.0), and `NCCL_SHM_USE_CUDA_MEMCPY=1` hung after
compile. Pipeline parallelism is not an option with this checkpoint: vLLM
refuses `--pipeline-parallel-size` because the multimodal
`Qwen3_5ForConditionalGeneration` class does not declare `SupportsPP`, even
with `--language-model-only`. The same box's native-Linux numbers are not
measured, so part of the TP=2 loss may be WSL2's.

Also reported working: **2× RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB**
([#22](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/issues/22)) — the "would
not fit on one card" case — and **4× RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB** (TP4, sm120, PCIe 4.0
x8, 180 W, community-patched P2P driver,
[#105](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/issues/105)). **4× RTX 3060 Ti 8 GB** (TP4, 110 W per
card, [#210](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/issues/210)) runs setup E as
shipped at 118.1 tok/s C1 greedy, and needs adapted profiles for the rest (see
the pin note above). **2× RTX 3060 12 GB with a P2P-patched driver**
([#205](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/issues/205)) runs setup D at
62.4. The graph budget
and `MAX_SEQS` defaults are still single-card calibrations; more A/Bs like
#40's are the most useful numbers you can send.

**With `SPEC=mtp` at TP>1, try int8 KV on `TRITON_ATTN` before fp8 on
FlashInfer.** #105's re-run separated what its first round had moved together,
one variable per arm, on 5060 Ti (sm120) at 180 W per card. MTP k=3, C1
greedy decode:

| | fp8 / FlashInfer | int8_per_token_head / `TRITON_ATTN` | gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| TP2 | 71.4 | 102.0 | 1.43x |
| TP4 | 72.8 | 137.6 | 1.89x |
| TP2, 2x RTX 3090 (sm86, uncapped, [#217](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/issues/217)) | 90.9 | 156.0 | 1.72x |

`tok/step` is 2.5-2.7 in every cell, so this is step time, not acceptance —
and the fp8/FlashInfer path does not scale with TP at all while the int8 path
does. The KV pool costs ~5-9% for it. This inverts the single-card picture,
where int8 on `TRITON_ATTN` is a long-context capacity trade that costs ~25% of
decode at depth (`docs/gotchas.md` 40), so it is not a launcher default yet. The
third row is the Ampere answer: two 3090s at TP=2 (peer-to-peer from a patched
driver, no NVLink) show the same shape, 2.53 against 2.57 `tok/step` at the
default temperature and roughly 31 against 18 ms per step.
It is at least not a correctness trap on Ampere: at TP1 on the reference 3090
(vLLM 0.29, async scheduling on) it passes the concurrent-garbage check from
[#121](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/issues/121) — three concurrent
~48K prompts three times over, then three alone, 9/9 and 3/3 valid, same as
the fp8/FlashInfer control.
The arm, for anyone who wants to check it on their own cards:

```
SPEC=mtp CTX=long EXTRA_ARGS="--tensor-parallel-size 2 --attention-backend TRITON_ATTN --kv-cache-dtype int8_per_token_head"
```
