# More than one GPU

What transfers to a second card and what does not, plus the tensor-parallel
shapes this model's head count allows.

[← back to the main README](../README.md)

Everything here is written for one 24 GB card; multi-GPU goes through untouched
via `EXTRA_ARGS`:

```bash
SPEC=dflash2 PREFIX_CACHE=1 EXTRA_ARGS="--tensor-parallel-size 2" bash single-user/start_qwen.sh
```

**`--tensor-parallel-size 3` is not valid for this model.** The checkpoint's
text config has 4 KV heads and 64 layers:

```bash
curl -sL https://huggingface.co/dbirks/Qwen3.8-27B-W4A16-AutoRound/raw/main/config.json \
  | python3 -c "import json,sys; t=json.load(sys.stdin)['text_config']; print(t['num_key_value_heads'], t['num_hidden_layers'])"
# 4 64
```

Tensor parallelism needs the KV-head count and the TP size to divide one
another, and 4 and 3 do neither way; pipeline parallelism needs an even layer
split, and 64 does not divide by 3. So on a three-card box the third card
cannot join the engine — run a TP=2 engine on two cards plus a second
standalone engine on the third
([#104](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/issues/104)), and if both
serve containers share one host, set `VLLM_OFFLOAD_KEEP_SHM=1` on both: each
launcher's stale-offload-region reaper only sees its own container's processes
and would delete the other engine's live region
([#33](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/issues/33)).

Under Docker, the same two knobs live in `.env` — `GPU_COUNT` says how many
cards the container gets, `EXTRA_ARGS` says how many the engine uses, and
nothing in `docker-compose.yml` needs editing:

```
GPU_COUNT=2
EXTRA_ARGS="--tensor-parallel-size 2 --language-model-only"
```

`GPU_COUNT` defaults to 1, which is *the first card the runtime enumerates* —
GPU 0, not necessarily the card you meant. On a mixed box, expose them all and
pin inside the container with `GPU_COUNT=all` plus `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1,2`
(the device reservation decides what is visible, so `NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`
in `.env` alone was not enough; `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` is read inside the
container and is what gotcha 53 recommends).

**Pin the KV pool before you measure anything, or before you trim `MAX_LEN`
until the OOMs stop.** Under `--tensor-parallel-size > 1` the launcher
deliberately skips the single-card `KV_MEM` pin (below), and `SPEC=mtp` has no
profile pin at all — so the pool is sized from `GPU_UTIL`, and the headroom it
is carved out of moves by ~0.92 GiB depending on whether the torch.compile
cache was warm (`docs/gotchas.md` 48). That is the "booted at 146k yesterday,
OOMs today" failure. To pin it, boot once at a context that works and read the
two lines the engine prints:

```bash
docker compose logs single | grep -E "Available KV cache memory|GPU KV cache size"
# INFO ... Available KV cache memory: 3.36 GiB
# INFO ... GPU KV cache size: 161,280 tokens
```

then put a byte count a little under that `GiB` figure into `.env` as
`KV_MEM=` (3.36 GiB ≈ 3607772528 bytes; round down). `KV_MEM` overrides the
TP skip — the launcher only declines to pin one *for* you. A pinned pool
either fits at boot or refuses at boot, instead of OOMing on the first
request, and it is the only way two benchmark arms are comparable.

What the second card is worth is now measured, not assumed —
[#40](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/issues/40) ran a controlled
1-vs-2×3090 A/B on this harness (same box, same install, PCIe 4.0 x8, **no
NVLink**, 275 W):

- **+16–35% decode across C1–C8** (DFlash2 greedy: 127.4 → 161.6 at C1). Worth
  it at batch 1: decode is bandwidth-bound here, and TP=2 is a second memory
  system, not idle compute.
- **The DFlash2 residency ceiling is a 24 GB property, not a drafter
  property.** On one card DFlash2 collapses at C8 (3.9 s TTFT — the
  recurrent-state pool exhaustion documented above) and MTP wins; on two cards
  DFlash2 wins at every concurrency measured. On 2×24 GB, point everyone at
  DFlash2.
- **The launcher no longer pins `KV_MEM` under TP>1** (their finding, this
  fix): the pin is a single-card constant applied per worker, and it stranded
  ~16 GiB across two cards — 137,210 tokens of pool where `GPU_UTIL` sizing
  gets 302,223, at no measured decode cost. Export `KV_MEM` to pin anyway.
- **Keep `DFLASH_TOKENS=7` at TP>1** for now: the one T=15 datapoint at TP=2
  (same issue) lost 27% at C1 with the lookup-filled tail accepting nothing,
  which is under diagnosis. The launcher warns.
- NVLink appears to buy little:
  [#7](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/issues/7)'s NVLink box at
  330 W and #40's PCIe-x8 box at 275 W land within a few percent of each other
  at C1.
- **Past two cards, or on a consumer board with the cards on separate PCIe root
  ports, you may need `NCCL_P2P_LEVEL=SYS`** and
  `EXTRA_ARGS="--disable-custom-all-reduce"`. Reported from a 4x RTX 5060 Ti box
  on a community-patched P2P driver
  ([#105](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/issues/105)): NCCL would
  not bring up peer-to-peer across four separate root ports until P2P was forced
  down to `SYS`, and vLLM's custom all-reduce faulted on that driver even at
  TP=2. Neither is reproducible on this repo's single-card box, so treat both as
  field reports, not as defaults — try TP first without them.

```bash
NCCL_P2P_LEVEL=SYS SPEC=dflash2 PREFIX_CACHE=1 \
  EXTRA_ARGS="--tensor-parallel-size 4 --disable-custom-all-reduce" \
  bash single-user/start_qwen.sh
```

**2x RTX 3090 with NVLink, both profiles, one box.** The fullest dual-card
report this repo has ([#159](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/issues/159),
[#163](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/issues/163),
[#164](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/issues/164): NV4 link, 250 W per
card, driver 595.91.07, Docker, vLLM 0.28.0, harness runs with a discarded
warmup and three measured repeats).

- **Start by turning the allocator off, not custom all-reduce off.** This box
  first came up only with `--disable-custom-all-reduce`; the crash behind that
  is the expandable-segments/IPC interaction in `docs/gotchas.md` 3, and
  clearing it properly is worth +6.4% at C1 (171.8 -> 182.8 tok/s greedy,
  3.32 tok/step in both arms) and ~9% at C4. Both launchers now default
  `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:False` when `EXTRA_ARGS` asks
  for TP>1 without `--disable-custom-all-reduce` or `--enforce-eager`, and say
  so at boot; set the variable yourself to override either way. That 182.8 is the single-user
  row in [docs/reproductions](reproductions/README.md), and it is the fastest
  C1 decode reported on Ampere here.
- **Batch, setup A, is where the second card pays.** `GPU_COUNT=2` with
  `EXTRA_ARGS="--tensor-parallel-size 2"` on the documented batch defaults
  (base checkpoint, `KV=fp8`, `INT8_ACT=int8 INT8_LAYERS=mlp`, `MAX_SEQS=64`,
  `MAX_LEN=150000`, no speculation, no prefix cache) gives 1,439 tok/s decode
  and 1,344 e2e at 64 concurrent on 128 in / 512 out, against ~1,035 / 948 on
  one card: **+39% aggregate**, with an 872,938-token KV pool and GSM8K 0.965
  over 200. Three measured repeats landed within 1% of each other.
- **That contradicts the other dual-3090 batch report, and the profile is
  why.** [#135](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/issues/135) measured 917
  decode at 64 concurrent on two cards -- *less* than one card -- but ran
  `KV=kvarn VISION=1` rather than the reference batch profile. Two cards do
  not make a batch server slower; a different KV dtype and a loaded vision
  tower do. Match the profile before you compare aggregates.
- **Single-user C1 does not scale the same way**, and that is expected: batch
  1 decode is bandwidth-bound, so TP=2 buys the ~35% in
  [#40](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/issues/40) and this box's +37%
  over the 133 tok/s reference, while the batch profile gets a second memory
  system *and* a second set of SMs to fill.

Also reported working: **2× RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB**
([#22](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/issues/22)) — the "would
not fit on one card" case — and **4× RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB** (TP4, sm120, PCIe 4.0
x8, 180 W, community-patched P2P driver,
[#105](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/issues/105)). The graph budget
and `MAX_SEQS` defaults are still single-card calibrations; more A/Bs like
#40's are the most useful numbers you can send.

**With `SPEC=mtp` at TP>1, try int8 KV on `TRITON_ATTN` before fp8 on
FlashInfer.** #105's re-run separated what its first round had moved together,
one variable per arm, on 5060 Ti (sm120) at 180 W per card. MTP k=3, C1
greedy decode:

| | fp8 / FlashInfer | int8_per_token_head / `TRITON_ATTN` | gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| TP2 | 71.4 | 102.0 | 1.43x |
| TP4 | 72.8 | 137.6 | 1.89x |

`tok/step` is ~2.7 in all four cells, so this is step time, not acceptance —
and the fp8/FlashInfer path does not scale with TP at all while the int8 path
does. The KV pool costs ~5-9% for it. This inverts the single-card picture,
where int8 on `TRITON_ATTN` is a long-context capacity trade that costs ~25% of
decode at depth (`docs/gotchas.md` 40), so it is not a launcher default: it is
one box, one card generation, and nobody has run the arm on Ampere at TP>1.
It is at least not a correctness trap on Ampere: at TP1 on the reference 3090
(vLLM 0.29, async scheduling on) it passes the concurrent-garbage check from
[#121](https://github.com/syv-ai/HyperQwen/issues/121) — three concurrent
~48K prompts three times over, then three alone, 9/9 and 3/3 valid, same as
the fp8/FlashInfer control.
If you have a dual-3090 box, that is the most useful A/B left in this file:

```
SPEC=mtp CTX=long EXTRA_ARGS="--tensor-parallel-size 2 --attention-backend TRITON_ATTN --kv-cache-dtype int8_per_token_head"
```
