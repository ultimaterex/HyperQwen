# qwen38-reasoning-effort-template

Vendored copy of Qwen3.8-27B's own `chat_template.jinja` with a **single semantic
change**: `reasoning_effort: "high"` is mapped onto `xhigh` instead of raising.

## The defect

Qwen3.8 renamed the conventional top reasoning rung. Its ladder is:

    low  <  medium  <  xhigh        (xhigh is also the default)

There is no `high`. The stock template hard-rejects anything else:

```jinja
{%- if resolved_reasoning_effort not in ('xhigh', 'medium', 'low') %}
    {{- raise_exception('Unexpected reasoning effort ...') }}
```

Both OpenAI and Anthropic use `low` / `medium` / `high`, so a generic client sending
the standard top rung gets a Jinja `TemplateError` surfaced as **HTTP 500**.

The failure is silent in the worst way: `/v1/models` and `/health` both return 200
and the model is demonstrably serving, so the endpoint looks healthy while every
thinking-mode chat request fails. Observed on the reference rig against vLLM's
Anthropic-compatible `POST /v1/messages?beta=true` — the surface a drop-in
Claude-API client talks to.

## Scope: all twenty vLLM slugs, one identical template

The template is **byte-identical across every served Qwen3.8 checkpoint** — official
FP8, the AutoRound INT4 repack, and the NVFP4 export all ship the same 8,952-byte file
(sha256 `c3cf9e34abf4f9e36c2d72165aa9c132d3e2a725b6c2586aaa3a8af9d7a81041`). Verified
by fetching each and comparing:

```bash
for r in Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B-FP8 Frozenlock/Qwen3.8-27B-int4-AutoRound RadixArk/Qwen3.8-27B-NVFP4; do
  curl -sL "https://huggingface.co/$r/resolve/main/chat_template.jinja" | sha256sum
done
```

So one vendored file is correct for every slug, and the quantiser is irrelevant.

**Re-verified 2026-08-21**, on two counts:

| checkpoint | `chat_template.jinja` sha256 | |
|---|---|---|
| `Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B-FP8` | `c3cf9e34…81041` | served |
| `Frozenlock/Qwen3.8-27B-int4-AutoRound` | `c3cf9e34…81041` | served (post-#1070 swap) |
| `RadixArk/Qwen3.8-27B-NVFP4` | `c3cf9e34…81041` | served |
| `syvai/Qwen3.8-27B-DFlash2-W4A16` | `f36668dd…ba59` | **drafter — never the render source** |

1. #1070 swapped the FAST tier's weights Avuja → Frozenlock, which would normally
   invalidate this file's provenance. It does not: the hash is unchanged, so the
   vendored copy is still the correct base.
2. #1072 added the DFlash2 super/ultra tiers, taking the slug count 8 → 20. The
   DFlash2 *drafter* repo ships a different template, but vLLM renders from the
   **served** model's tokenizer, so that file is deliberately not vendored.

## The change

A short mapping inserted before the validation. `high` maps to **`xhigh`**,
Qwen3.8's real top rung.

### Why `xhigh` and not `medium`

The original submission mapped `high` onto `medium`, reasoning that `medium` is
the un-nudged baseline while `xhigh` injects a "think carefully, validate
assumptions, consider alternatives" preamble that is slow and timeout-prone — and
that a Claude-API client sends `high` on *every* request, so mapping to the top
rung would push all agent traffic into the slowest mode on slugs shipping
`max_num_seqs=1`. That cost is real and documented in the compose headers.

It was changed to `xhigh` on merge, for three reasons:

1. **Bijection.** `low`/`medium`/`high` maps onto `low`/`medium`/`xhigh` with the
   ordering intact. Under the `medium` mapping, two distinct client values collapse
   onto one server behaviour and the top rung becomes **unreachable through
   standard OpenAI/Anthropic vocabulary at all**.
2. **These are not a scale with a middle.** `medium` has no template branch and
   injects nothing. So mapping the top rung there does not hand the caller "one
   rung down" — it hands them *no reasoning instruction whatsoever*, which is the
   opposite of what they asked for.
3. **The cost belongs in the default, not the vocabulary.** Traffic that sends no
   `reasoning_effort` is governed by the server default (`low`, set via
   `--default-chat-template-kwargs`) and is unaffected by this mapping. A caller
   that explicitly sends `high` has opted in. If `xhigh` is too slow for a given
   agent, the agent should send `medium` — the server should not silently
   reinterpret the word.

⚠️ The trade this accepts: clients that hardcode `high` land on the slow path.
That is deliberate, per-request, and reversible by the caller.

Everything else is byte-identical to upstream.

## Drop when

Upstream Qwen accepts `high` as an alias (costs them nothing), **or** vLLM's
Anthropic router stops forwarding a `high` it cannot know is unsupported. Re-vendor
from the model dir if Qwen ships a corrected template, and re-run the drift guard.
