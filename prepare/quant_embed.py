"""Requantize the token embedding table to int8 (group-128, symmetric),
in place. Companion to quant_lm_head.py — run that one first.

Qwen3.8-27B has untied embeddings, so embed_tokens is a second 2.5 GB bf16
matrix on top of lm_head. vLLM ships a dequant-on-gather path for int-quantized
embeddings (CompressedTensorsEmbeddingWNA16Int) but the qwen3_5 model code
never passes quant_config to VocabParallelEmbedding, so you also need the
two-line patch in patches/qwen3_5-embed-quant.patch.

Usage: python prepare/quant_embed.py /path/to/Qwen3.8-27B-W4A16-AutoRound

Rewrites the shard holding embed_tokens, config.json and the safetensors index, in
that order, through prepare/atomic_publish.py (a temp file and a rename). The index
goes last: docker/prepare.sh's state() reads only the index, so a killed run leaves the
step pending, and the next run completes it, reusing a shard that already holds the
packed embeddings (#195).

Measured on an RTX 3090: another ~1.3 GB freed, round-trip error 0.56%.
