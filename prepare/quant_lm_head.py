"""Requantize lm_head to int8 (group-128, symmetric) in compressed-tensors
pack-quantized format, in place.

The published W4A16 quants of Qwen3.8-27B leave lm_head in bf16 — that's a
2.5 GB matrix (248k vocab) read every decode step. int8 halves the read and
frees ~1.3 GB of VRAM for the KV/state pool. Measured +12% aggregate
throughput on an RTX 3090, round-trip error 0.64% (Frobenius).

Usage: python prepare/quant_lm_head.py /path/to/Qwen3.8-27B-W4A16-AutoRound

Rewrites the shard containing lm_head.weight, config.json and the safetensors
index, in that order. The first pre-quant copy of each is kept next to it
(.bak for the shard, .bak-quant for config and index) and never overwritten.

Each file is written through prepare/atomic_publish.py (a temp file and a
rename), and the index goes last: docker/prepare.sh's state() reads only the
index, so a killed run leaves the step pending, and the next run completes it,
reusing a shard that already holds the packed lm_head (#195).
