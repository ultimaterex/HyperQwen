"""Requantize the MTP (multi-token-prediction) draft module to int8 or int4
(group-128, symmetric) in compressed-tensors pack-quantized format, in place.

The published W4A16 quant leaves the whole `mtp.*` module in bf16 (~850 MB:
mtp.fc plus one full decoder layer). In single-user mode that module runs once
per draft token, so at 4 drafts/step it is read four times per step; int8
halves that traffic, int4 quarters it. The draft head only steers speculation
(acceptance rate) — the sampled distribution stays exact either way — so this
is a pure speed knob. Measured acceptance change: int8 none.

Usage: python prepare/quant_mtp.py /path/to/Qwen3.8-27B-W4A16-AutoRound [--bits 8|4] [--keep-fc]
--keep-fc leaves mtp.fc (the 10240->5120 input projection, 105 MB) in bf16.

Rewrites model_extra_tensors.safetensors, config.json and the safetensors index, in
that order; the first pre-quant copy of each is kept as <file>.bak-mtp and never
overwritten. Each file is written through prepare/atomic_publish.py (a temp file and a
rename), and the index goes last: docker/prepare.sh's state() reads only the index, so
a killed run leaves the step pending, and the next run completes it, reusing a shard
that already holds the packed linears (#195).
