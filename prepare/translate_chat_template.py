"""Translate a Qwen3.8 chat template's reasoning-effort vocabulary so client
supplied effort levels can no longer 400 the server.

The shipped chat_template.jinja accepts exactly xhigh/medium/low and defaults
to xhigh. OpenAI-protocol clients speak the gpt-5 vocabulary --
none/minimal/low/medium/high/xhigh/max -- so `minimal` (and `high`, `max`)
raise jinja2.TemplateError inside the template and vLLM surfaces that as a
400 Bad Request on every request that carries one (docs/gotchas.md 58).

This rewrites the effort block in place to:

  - map only the names the template does not know: minimal -> low,
    high/max -> xhigh,
  - leave every other value falling through unchanged, so the template's own
    levels (low/medium/xhigh) keep their exact behaviour and an omitted effort
    keeps the template default (xhigh),
  - drop the raise, so an unknown value no longer 400s. It then produces no
    reasoning instruction, the same outcome as `medium` -- nothing is silently
    rewritten to a stronger level.

Idempotent: the `{#- effort-translation v2 ... -#}` marker short-circuits
re-runs, so prepare.sh can call this on every boot, and a re-download that
clobbers chat_template.jinja is re-translated on the next prepare. A template
carrying the older v1 block (default and fallback both `medium`) is upgraded in
place, so a model dir prepared with v1 does not keep that default. A template
whose effort block matches no known shape is left alone with a warning: this
runs under `set -e` after the download and requantisation, so it must never
fail prepare over a ready model directory.

Usage: python prepare/translate_chat_template.py MODEL_DIR [MODEL_DIR ...]
