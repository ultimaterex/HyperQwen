# Single-user serving wrapper: boot the launcher, wait for /health, run the
# post-boot serving warmup, then wait on the server.
#
# Why: start_qwen.sh ends in `exec vllm serve`, so a systemd unit has no
# after-boot hook. /health can return 200 before the serving path has actually
# been exercised, and two things are still owed at that point:
#
#   * The transient allocation of the first real batch. On a tightly packed
#     24 GB config that bill is due either here, under controlled conditions,
#     or inside a user's first prompt (gotcha 35).
#   * The Triton variants the boot-time profile does not cover. #48's prewarm
#     closed the CTX=huge set; gotcha 45's scope note records three kernels
#     (_k_stats_kernel, _k_quant_kernel, _prefill_attn_kernel) still compiling
#     in-request on the current production profile (CTX=fast, INT8_ACT=int8
#     PREFILL_ATTN=int8). The real home for those is a prewarm patch; until
#     one exists, a warmup pass absorbs them.
#
#   WARMUP=1             wait for /health, run bench/warmup.sh, then serve
#   WARMUP=0 (default)   just wait on the server (what the unit does today)
#
# The warmup is advisory: a health timeout or a failed warmup logs and falls
# through to serving, because a server that answers /health is more useful than
# a restart loop. The wrapper's exit code is the server's, so Restart=on-failure
# behaves as before. To enable it in the unit:
#   Environment=WARMUP=1
#   ExecStart=/bin/bash %h/qwen-serving/single-user/qwen-server.sh
