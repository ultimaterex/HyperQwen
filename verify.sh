# Zero points. One check, in two halves; it replaces the head-group block #158 added
# and keeps that block's rule and its advice.
#
# Head groups (lm_head, embed_tokens, mtp) must be symmetric, whether or not their
# weight_zero_point tensors were written. prepare/ writes those tensors symmetric --
# quant_heads_stream.py builds the head groups from group_0 and forces
# symmetric=true / zp_dtype=null on them -- and the paths that read them take no zero
# point: the quantized embedding lookup (CompressedTensorsEmbeddingWNA16Int) registers
# weight_packed, weight_scale and weight_shape and nothing else, and
# build_draft_vocab.py copies the lm_head's packed rows and scales, nothing else, into
# mtp.draft_lm_head. (The failure mode quant_heads_stream.py exists to normalize away,
# and the PR #139 field report.)
#
# Every packed module: vLLM builds the layer from the group it resolves to. An
# asymmetric group registers a weight_zero_point for the checkpoint to fill, and when
# the tensor is not there nothing says so -- the loader's missing-weight check is off
# for quantized models (model_loader/default_loader.py) -- so the layer serves on
# uninitialized zero points. A symmetric group registers none, and a weight_zero_point
# written for it is refused at load ("There is no module or parameter named ...").
# An asymmetric *body* group is legitimate: an AWQ body carries real zero points --
# philbert440/Qwen3.8-27B-Uncensored-Aggressive-W4A16-AWQ, this repo's own worked
# example, is symmetric=false on group_0 and serves fine, and
# patches/marlin-int8-asym-zp.patch runs such bodies on the INT8_ACT=int8 path too.
# The group is resolved the way vLLM's find_matched_target does it: modules in
# "ignore" are skipped, then the first target in config order that names the module
# (exactly, or re: with re.match), else a "Linear" class target -- which never covers
# the embedding or an LM head, since those are not Linear layers in vLLM.
#
# An absent "symmetric" key means symmetric: QuantizationArgs declares
# symmetric: bool = True (compressed_tensors quant_args.py), so a foreign
# export that omits it must not be read as asymmetric.
